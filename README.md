## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is another redo of the testimonials grid section. It came out much closer to the design than the first time. I learned a lot about how to use grid and flexbox together to get the layout I wanted. I also continued to sue custom properties for the colors, font sizes and spacing.

### Continued development

I can use some more experience using grid.
